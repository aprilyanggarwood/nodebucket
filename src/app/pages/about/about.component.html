          nodeBucket is a user- and mobile-friendly task management app from
          House Gryffindor that helps you manage your tasks anytime, anywhere.
          If your life is busy, or you need to multitask at work, you definitely
          need a great digital tool like nodeBucket to help you be organized,
          efficient, and productive.
          <br /><br />
          nodebucket is designed with a simple and intuitive user interface,
          making it easy for young and old to create and manage tasks using the
          application. Every time a user creates a new task, that task will be
          listed in the to-do list column. Any task can be dragged and dropped
          to a new location vertically in the task list column based on the
          user's priority. Tasks can also be updated and deleted when the user
          needs to keep them up to date. All tasks can be tracked as they are
          done and dragged and dropped into the task done list column. If the
          user has the same task again, the task in the done list column can
          also be dragged and dropped back to the to-do list column so that the
          user does not need to create the same task again. Meanwhile, any task
          in the done list column can be deleted if the user no longer needs
          this done task in the done list column.
          <br /><br />
          nodebucket can help housewives become life experts, time management
          masters, and super moms that everyone envies. nodebucket can help the
          elderly to record daily tasks or things so that they can live
          independently with more confidence. Children can also use this app to
          learn how to record things, organize things, and manage time.
          <br /><br />
          If you like to use this app, please share your user experience with
          us, and your friends and family around you. We will be very grateful
          and keep developing new features for this app.
          <br /><br />
          We believe that nodebucket is your lifesaver, making your life simple
          and organized.
